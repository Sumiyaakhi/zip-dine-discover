This is a web application for a list of restaurants categorised by their location states.
- In here I use data.json file for fetching the whole data because of the given url is not working.
- I used only React JS for making this application.
- On here, I use Tailwind CSS and daisyui for styling.
- I added a simple banner and footer here.
